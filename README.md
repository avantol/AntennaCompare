# AntennaCompare
Compare efficiency of two antennas transmitting simultaneously, using PSKReporter SNR report data.
You'll find out if your new antenna is more effective than your old antenna... in dB, to several decimal places.
<br><br>VERY useful data (better than YouTubers saying "It must be good cuz I got some QSOs"), so leave the old antenna up until you can run this comparison... THEN take down the loser after the shootout.
<br><br>Easy to use: simply run WSJT-X on two transmitters, using a reference antenna and an antenna under test, at equal power.
<br><br>AntennaCompare analyzes the <i>simultaneous</i> signal reports from around the world, reducing the propagation effects to those that are caused by the antennas, making signal report comparisons meaningful.
