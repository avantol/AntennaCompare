# AntennaCompare
Compare efficiency of two HF (or VHF) antennas transmitting FT8 simultaneously on practically the same frequency, using PSKReporter SNR report data.
You'll find out if your new antenna is more effective than your old antenna... in dB, to several decimal places.
<br><br>VERY useful data (better than YouTubers saying "It must be good cuz I got some QSOs"), so leave the old antenna up until you can run this comparison... THEN take down the loser after the shootout.
<br><br>Easy to use: simply run FT8 (using WSJT-X or similar) on two transmitters, one transmitter connected to a reference antenna and the other transmitter connected to the antenna under test, at equal power.
<br><br>AntennaCompare analyzes the <i>simultaneous</i> signal reports from around the world, reducing the propagation effects to those that are caused by the antennas, making signal report comparisons meaningful. Why use FT8 and not WSPR? Simple, I'm not seeing nearly as many DX stations reporting WSPR as FT8... that makes AntennaCompare perfect for optimizing your new DX creation.
