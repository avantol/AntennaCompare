# AntennaCompare
 Compare efficiency of two antennas transmitting simultaneously using PSKReporter data.
 <br>Easy to use: simply run WSJT-X on two transmitters, using a reference antenna at an antenna under test, at equal power.
 <br>AntennaCompare analyzes simultaneous signal reports from around the world, reducing the propagation effects to those that are caused by the antennas, making signal report comparisons meaningful.
 <br><br><i>(Microsoft thinks the installer is a virus.</i> Pffft. so, build and run it yourself (VS2019)).
